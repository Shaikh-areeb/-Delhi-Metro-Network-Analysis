# Observations
Elevated Stations: The majority of the stations are Elevated. It is a common design choice in urban areas to save space and reduce land acquisition issues.

Underground Stations: The Underground stations are fewer compared to elevated ones. These are likely in densely populated or central areas where above-ground construction is less feasible.

At-Grade Stations: There are only a few At-Grade (ground level) stations, suggesting they are less common in the network, possibly due to land and traffic considerations.

# Summary
Metro Network Analysis involves examining the network of metro systems to understand their structure, efficiency, and effectiveness. 
It typically includes analyzing routes, stations, traffic, connectivity, and other operational aspects.
